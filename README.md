First, if you have 0 programming or AI knowledge, please follow [this guide](https://github.com/louisfb01/start-machine-learning) I made for this exact purpose and come back here!

This guide is intended for anyone with a small background in programming and machine learning. There is no specific order to follow, but a classic path would be from top to bottom. If you don't like reading books, skip them. If you don't want to follow an online course, you can also skip it. There is not a single way to become a machine learning expert, and with motivation, you can absolutely achieve it.

All resources listed here are free, except some online courses and books, which are certainly recommended for a better understanding, but it is definitely possible to become an expert without them, with a little more time spent on online readings, videos, and practice. When it comes to paying courses, the links in this guide are affiliated links. Please use them if you feel like following a course, as it will support me. Thank you, and have fun learning! Remember, this is completely up to you and not necessary. I felt like it was useful to me and maybe useful to others as well.

Don't be afraid to repeat videos or learn from multiple sources. Repetition is the key of success to learning!

## Prerequesites<a name="prerequesites"></a>

If you have 0 programming or AI knowledge, please follow [this guide](https://github.com/louisfb01/start-machine-learning) I made for this exact purpose. Check out the python section mostly and then you will have a strong enough background to come back here!

If you are somewhat familiar with Python and AI, then I wish you happy learning!


## Start with short YouTube video introductions as a first step<a name="youtubevideos"></a>
### Start with short YouTube videos introductions
This is the best way to start from nothing. Here, I list a few of the best videos I found that will give you a great first introduction to the terms you need to know to get started in the LLM field.
    
* Understanding the terminology
    * [Mastering AI Jargon - Your Guide to OpenAI & LLM Terms - What's AI](https://youtu.be/q4G6X09NEu4) - A quick introduction to the most used terms in the LLM (or GPT) world.
* Understanding Transformers and LLMs (i.e. models behind ChatGPT)!
   * [Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs8w1Cdi-zvYskDS2icIItfZgxclApVLv) - amazing video introductions to the attention mechanism, tokens, embeddings and more to better understand everything behind large language models like GPT by [Luis Serrano](https://twitter.com/SerranoAcademy).
   * [What are Transformer Models and how do they work?](https://youtu.be/qaWMOYf4ri8) - [Luis Serrano](https://twitter.com/SerranoAcademy)
   * [The Illustrated Word2vec - A Gentle Intro to Word Embeddings in Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/ISPId9Lhc1g) - A clear explanation of word embeddings in machine learning by [Jay Alammar](https://twitter.com/JayAlammar).
   * [A Hackers' Guide to Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkrNMKz9pWU) - by [Jeremy Howard (fast.ai)](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward).
   * [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) - by [Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy).

Another easy **way to get started and keep learning is by listening to podcasts** in your spare time. Driving to work, on the bus, or having trouble falling asleep? Listen to some AI podcasts to get used to the terms and patterns, and learn about the field through inspiring stories! I invite you to follow a few of the best I personally prefer, like [Lex Fridman](https://open.spotify.com/show/2MAi0BvDc6GTFvKFPXnkCL), [Machine Learning Street Talk](https://open.spotify.com/show/02e6PZeIOdpmBGT9THuzwR), and obviously, my podcast: [What's AI by Louis Bouchard](https://open.spotify.com/show/4rKRJXaXlClkDyInjHkxq3), where you will learn about incredibly talented people in the field with inspiring stories sharing the knowledge they worked so hard to gather. A new one I really enjoy listening to that keeps me up to date is the [ThursdAI podcast](https://thursdai.news/) by my friend [Alex Volkov](https://twitter.com/altryne).

## Here is a list of awesome courses available on YouTube that you should definitely follow and are 100% free.

* What's AI's LLM free course videos "[Train & Fine-Tune LLMs for Production Course by Activeloop, Towards AI & Intel Disruptor](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO4GrDnQanVcPlQUBuMd_pwRkILfc463G&si=QbXeHeDs5RSKH3nY)". "A playlist for our LLM course: Gen AI 360: Foundational Model Certification!"
* [Create a Large Language Model from Scratch with Python – Tutorial](https://youtu.be/UU1WVnMk4E8) - by [freeCodeCamp](https://twitter.com/freeCodeCamp). "Learn how to build your own large language model, from scratch. This course goes into the data handling, math, and transformers behind large language models. You will use Python."

* [The Attention Mechanism in Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCpWwDCDFQ&list=PLs8w1Cdi-zva4fwKkl9EK13siFvL9Wewf) - by Luis Serrano. In this video series, Luis explains the Transformer architecture going increasingly in depth. It is a very good overview and explanation of Transformers and the attention mechanism that I believe should be watched by all AI professionals.


## LLM Books and articles (for readers)<a name="readers"></a>
If you prefer the article and reading path, here are some suggestions:

* [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) - by Jay Alammar. This is a famous article providing an amazing explanation to how current language models work.
* [A Practical Introduction to LLMs](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-practical-introduction-to-llms-65194dda1148) - by [Shawhin Talebi](https://shawhin.medium.com/).

* [Large Language Models with Semantic Search](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/large-language-models-semantic-search/) - Free, Deeplearning.ai and Cohere

You can easily google for more, but after reading and watching those, I believe you already have a good enough understanding of LLMs to get into the real deal: practice.


## Practice, practice, and practice!<a name="practice"></a>
### Practice is key

The most important thing in programming is practice. This applies to machine learning too. It can be hard to find a personal project to practice. I strongly advise you to try to build something by yourself, but I understand it may be intimidating. What I would then suggest is to follow one or two **extremely** applied courses and use the resource to build your own project based on the code examples they provide you, and ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot to [work for you](#domore) as a code assistant for the rest of the work.

Here are a few of the most applied courses I could find for LLMs:

* Looking to build a quick text classification model or word vectorizer, [fasttext](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/supervised-tutorial.html) is a good library to quickly train up a model.
* [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1) is THE place to get modern day NLP models, and they also include a whole [course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1) about it.
* [LangChain & Vector Databases in Production](https://learn.activeloop.ai/courses/langchain/) - An amazing free resource we built at Towards AI in partnership with Activeloop and the Intel Disruptor Initiative to learn about LangChain & Vector Databases in Production. "Whether you are an experienced developer who's a newcomer to the AI realm or an experienced machine learning enthusiast, this course is designed for you. Our goal is to make AI accessible and practical, transforming how you approach your daily tasks and the overall impact of your work."
* [Training & Fine-Tuning LLMs for Production](https://learn.activeloop.ai/courses/llms/) - An amazing free resource we built at Towards AI in partnership with Activeloop and the Intel Disruptor Initiative to learn about Training & Fine-Tuning LLMs for Production. "If you want to learn how to train and fine-tune LLMs from scratch and have intermediate Python knowledge as well as access to moderate compute resources (for some cases, just a Google Colab will suffice!), you should be all set to take and complete the course. This course is designed with a wide audience in mind, including beginners in AI, current machine learning engineers, students, and professionals considering a career transition to AI. We aim to provide you with the necessary tools to apply and tailor Large Language Models across a wide range of industries to make AI more accessible and practical."
* [The Real-World ML Tutorial & Community](https://realworldmachinelearning.carrd.co/) - Paid

A reminder. The best way to learn is to build something! I really prone to learn by doing. Those courses are all great but optional. You can do it on your own, and most companies providing resources for working with LLMs (OpenAI, LangChain, Activeloop, Cohere, W&B...) have great tutorials to get you started and build something. Then, you can [ask ChatGPT](#domore) to help you finish it!


## Prompting<a name="prompting"></a>
Prompting is an important new skill to learn for both using the models and building NLP-related apps.

* [What is Prompting? Talking with AI Models...](https://youtu.be/pZsJbYIFCCw) - Free
* [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://imp.i384100.net/rQBVMy) - Paid
* [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/) - This is a great **free** course intending to teach prompting and give tips for specific models. It is **all you need** for prompting!
* [Techniques to improve reliability](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/articles/techniques_to_improve_reliability.md#techniques-to-improve-reliability) - OpenAI Cookbook on prompting techniques.

## More on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)<a name="rag"></a>
Most people build RAG-based apps currently. Here are a few resources that I loved to get you started and have a good understanding of it...

## Learn more and do more... with LLMs<a name="domore"></a>
ChatGPT, Bing, Claude... are incredible. Of course, they have limitations. Yet, you can leverage those to learn anything you want. I use it for coding or asking lots of questions in general. You need to double-check when you ask for important questions.
Still, it is a powerful **tool**. Yes, it is a tool, not a human replacement. Use it as a _dumb_ assistant that knows about pretty much everything.

Here's [a clear example](https://chat.openai.com/share/883389c9-f0f8-4a3e-a3af-ee9860d448a8) of how I used it for a project to better understand a function from a project I was not familiar with. This is for python, but those models are extremely powerful for coding in general, understanding new platforms (like AWS, GCP, working with a virtual machine, a server, SSH connections, etc.... anything you are not familiar with that is useful in the LLM space).

_p.s. I didn't mention Bing and Claude for fun. Don't be overly dependent on a single company like OpenAI. There are (and will always be) other companies in the fight for the best LLM. I wanted to create an example for the guide this morning when..._
